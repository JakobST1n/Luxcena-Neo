# Plans for the future

* Socketio
    * [ ] Rewrite socketio to use auth
    * [ ] Make all action respond to the client, so that it knows wether the action was a success or not.
* [ ] Rewrite public-dir to load pages with javascript, and have one handler, instead of a seperate html file per page.
* Neo IDE
    * [ ] Add intellisense for `neo_behaviour`
