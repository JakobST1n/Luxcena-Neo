## Install
Please refer to this guide for installing: [Install Luxcena-neo](Usage/Install.md).
## Issues
* *There might still be a bit hard for someone not having spent
   hours looking at the source to use this software.
   The hope is that it will be more useable for every new update.*
* Chrome is the __ONLY__ tested browser, there is no reason it shouldn't work in
  other modern browsers as well. But you might see some weird behaviour.
