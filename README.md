## Wiki
The wiki will be available right in the browser when you have the software installed. If you want to contribute, you follow standard procedures for contributing here, and change/add/delete the markdown-files found in `/docs`. Don't worry about the `_book` folder, as that contains the generated html wiki.
## Install
To install, follow the guide here: [Install Luxcena-Neo](https://github.com/JakobST1n/Luxcena-Neo/blob/master/docs/Usage/Install.md)

The link there won't work on github, only when starting the software. So here is the link to the configuration-guide:
[Configuring Luxcena-Neo](https://github.com/JakobST1n/Luxcena-Neo/blob/master/docs/Usage/Configuration.md)

## Issues
*There might still be a bit hard for someone not having spent hours looking at the source to use this software. But i assure you that it will be really easy to use shortly*
